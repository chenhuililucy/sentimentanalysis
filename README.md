The paper provides augmentations on the Loughran McDonald (2011) dictionary to introduce a series of dictionaries used in analyzing financial disclosure. The dictionaries incorporate sentiment, financial context and are suited to both feature and sentiment extraction. Our dictionary is the first open sourced toolkit that would allow researchers to dive deeper into both sentiment and content analysis. Researchers can use our dictionary to produce feature sets/sentences containing the feature set. This can make their analysis more efficient and thorough. It may be used by professionals conducting fundamental/quantitative research on stocks and may be used to support the bag of words method and machine learning methods.

The repository contains codes used to develop the dictionaries.
